This project was part of the final <a href="https://github.com/Fasust/stackexchange_data_analysis/blob/master/material/MA120%20Big%20Data%20ASSIGNMENT%201%2028.09.18%20kl%2015.pdf">assignment</a> of the module “Big Data” at Høyskolen Kristiania.

We used the Hadoop MapReduce framework to analyse a large collection data from the forum <a href="https://scifi.stackexchange.com/">stackexchange</a> regarding the topic “Science Fiction”. 
The analysis was mainly focused on users and blog posts.
This repository includes all the MapReduce-Jobs we created to fulfill the tasks outlined in the assignment.
